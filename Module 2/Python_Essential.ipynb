This allows for easier debugging and faster development cycles.\n","2. **High-Level Language**: Python is designed to be human-readable and has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax. This makes it suitable for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n","3. **Dynamically Typed**: Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The type of a variable is inferred at runtime based on the value assigned to it.\n","4. **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces or keywords like begin and end. This enforces clean and readable code but can also lead to syntax errors if not used correctly.\n","5. **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Everything in Python is an object, including integers, strings, functions, and classes.\n","6. **Functional Programming Features**: While primarily an object-oriented language, Python also supports functional programming paradigms. It includes features like lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce functions, as well as support for list comprehensions.\n","7. **Platform Independent**: Python code can run on any platform with a Python interpreter installed, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and UNIX. This makes Python highly portable and adaptable to different environments.\n","8. **Community and Ecosystem**: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem by creating libraries, frameworks, and tools. This vibrant ecosystem makes it easy to find solutions to problems and accelerates development.\n","9. **Versatile Usage**: Python is used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, scripting, and more. Its versatility and ease of use make it a popular choice across industries."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"0fc2edd5","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Hello World\n"]}],"source":["print(\"Hello World\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bcba1b79-6da8-4bdf-96a6-15b9ee3eae82","metadata":{"id":"bcba1b79-6da8-4bdf-96a6-15b9ee3eae82"},"source":["## Commenting\n","Commenting is the process of adding annotations or remarks within your code to provide explanations, context, or documentation.
